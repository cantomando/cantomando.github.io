This guide is intended as a basic review for beginners and newcomers to learning Cantonese, in preparation for the Medical Cantonese course materials by CMIG (Chinese Medicine Interest Group) of UCLA DGSOM and Stanford APAMSA (Asian Pacific American Medical Student Association). The overarching aim is not to be able to read and write fluently, but instead to be able to communicate. 
All medical vocabulary will be taught in separate lessons and workbooks, including basic anatomy, clinical signs, diagnostics, and therapeutics. This guide serves as an introduction before progressing to delving into the specifics of medical Cantonese.
